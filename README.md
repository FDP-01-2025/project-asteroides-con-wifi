## üß† Theme and setting

 You need to go with **Noctriz** in a space adventure full of missions to save all the population of  **Algoritmia**, they have been kidnapped by an AI.This game implies logic in different ways ,memory and chanllenges across the intersllestar space. 

---

## üéÆ  Principal Game Mechanic 

The player will face different  **missions** in different planets:

- Solve logic puzzles.
- Find supplies(memogram).
- Find passwords.
- Participate in a space career.

Each mission corresponds to a module of the program and allows access to an interactive menu . This menu lets the player choose the planet they would like to start with, which will be their first destination .
---

## üïπÔ∏è General gameplay idea 

1. The player starts with Noctriz, astronaut of Algoritmia.

2. The player can choose between differents missions in the pincipal menu. 

3. Each mission in every minigame has its own logic and mechanics.

4. Each dessicion and it's results will appear at the console.

5. After completing all the missions, the player frees Algoritmia from the AI.

## üíª Applying the concepts learned

| **Course Topics**                  | **AGame Application**                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Variables and Data Types**      | Uses `int`, `float`, `bool`, and `string` to control gameplay elements in missions.   |
| **Conditional Structures**        | Implements `if`, `else`, and `switch` to allow player decisions that impact the game's flow and outcomes. |
| **Loops (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)** | Used for repeating attempts, validating input, and creating interactive mission logic.  |
| **Functions**                     | Missions and utility features are organized into modular functions (e.g., `startMission1()`, `checkProgress()`). |
| **Data Structures**               | Arrays like `string[]` and `int[]` are used to manage data in mini-games.              |
| **File Handling**                 | Game scores and progress are saved using `fstream`.                                   |
| **Error Handling**                | Validates user input to prevent crashes and ensure a smooth user experience.           |
| **Console Interface**             | Uses `cout`, `cin`, separators, and ASCII art to build interactive and visually appealing menus. |


## üõ†Ô∏èTechnical Considerations of Development

- Lenguage: C++
- Used IDE : Visual Studio Code
- Repository shared in GitHub
- Modularization: Each mission is contained in its own`.cpp` and `.h`
- The `main.cpp`  file only includes calls to the primary functions of each mission **OWL ROCKET**.
